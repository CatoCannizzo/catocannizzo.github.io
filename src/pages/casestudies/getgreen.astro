  <h3>Process Overview</h3>

  <p><b>Problem Definition:</b></p>
  <p>
    Through talking to Get Green we explored the directions they wanted to grow
    their app and they immediately talked about user retention. My team and I
    described various methods of increasing retention, and while initially Get
    Green wanted to explore some geo-location based features, they settled on
    gamifying their app due to development limitations on their end.
  </p>
  <p><b>Exploring the problem:</b></p>
  <p>
    To understand where Get Green was losing users. My group sought to
    understand long term pain points with a diary study, while searching for
    short term pain points with a participatory design session. Additionally we
    used a survey to search for outlining  issues we might have missed in both
    techniques.
  </p>
  <p><b>Design:</b></p>
  <p>
    The team and I then synthesized the data from our user research, ideated
    through solutions grading them on feasibility and cohesion, then wireframed
    a series of potential solutions.
  </p>
  <p><b>Evaluation:</b></p>
  <p>
    Once we had a cohesive design system that addressed all the pain points we
    found. We validated our selected solutions by running usability tests on
    lofi prototypes. Once validated we created high fi prototypes and design
    assets for Get Green to integrate.
  </p>
  <h2>Exploring the Problem Space</h2><p>
    Get Green is a sustainability habit building app that is looking to reduce
    its users carbon foot print through task recommendations and eco-friendly
    goals. Due to an abundance of time and high engagement with Get Green our
    team was able to deeply dive into the problem space. Over two weeks our team
    set up a multiple week diary study, a survey of additional users, and a
    focused three-person participatory design session.
  </p>

      width="500"
      class=""
    />
    <figcaption>
      Most people using the app were passively interested in reducing their
      carbon foot print, but did not want to give up their quality of their lifestyle.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We then synthesized the data we collected through affinity mapping, and
    created user personas based off of the participatory design and surveys.
    Once the data from the diary studies came back we were able to create
    accurate journey maps.
  </p>

  <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <Image
      src={JourneyMap}
      alt="Journey map of an personified GetGreen user showing the user getting more frustrated as they realize the limitations of the GetGreen app."
      class="popout"
    />
    <figcaption>
      It was an almost constant finding in our research that the app annoyed its
      users after about 2-3 days with it through actionless notifications, or an
      inability to make it feel personalized.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    From the data we collected we offered the following advice to GetGreen.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Smooth out information presentation in the app, by reducing first login
        questions and adding popups on the second or third login.
      </li>
      <li>Redesign how users add track and manage action items</li>
      <li>Increase personalization of the app through unique goals.</li>
    </ol>

    After discussions with GetGreen, we prioritized the following design spaces
    and began wireframing solutions: <ol>
      <li>Action item redesign</li>
      <li>Personalization Settings</li>
      <li>App navigation & onboarding</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>Design & Redesign</h2>
  <p>
    To understand how we might create such features we ideated through several
    ideas. Once we had solutions to each problem, we used wireframes to see how
    we could combine them into a cohesive system that would continually keep
    users engaged. These wireframes captured big picture ideas such as content
    layout, features, and navigation of the Get Green app.
  </p>
  <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <Image
      src={Wireframe}
      alt="Wireframe of a homescreen page showing a draft layout of the Get Green app."
      class="max-w-[250px]"
    />
    <figcaption>
      Here we attempted to redesign the home screen to show users actions that
      they could look forward to doing.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Then we took our final design system and made low fidelity prototypes. We
    combined the lofi prototypes with user flow diagrams to show how users could
    go about adding and tracking action items as well as navigating throughout
    the different functionalities.
  </p>

  <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <Image
      src={LofiPrototype}
      alt="Collection of several low fidelity screenshots with arrows pointing from page to page."
      class="popout"
    />
    <figcaption>
      In terms of overall experience, our low fidelity designs averaged at 81
      out of 100 on the US Government's System Usability Scale.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    Then we conducted a short usability test with select users on these lofi
    designs. We had the participants complete four tasks while thinking out loud
    throughout the process. Then we graded our prototypes by the following
    metrics: number of critical errors made by users, satisfaction rates, and
    our own observation of the users. This final round of user testing gave us
    feedback on small pain points and which user flows were more used that we
    were able to incorporate into our final mock up.
  </p>
  <p>
    We then recreated our designs into high fidelity wireframes incorporating
    the visual branding and UI elements of the GetGreen application. First we
    completely redesigned the onboarding module to help users to have  shorter
    initial sessions within the app followed closely by several more consistent
    sessions in the following days.
  </p>
  <!-- !!! Add second pic (goal actions) here when ready to experiment with tables -->
  <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <Image src={GoalPage} alt="An image of an alternative Get Green on boarding experience that prompts the user to select a goal they want to accomplish with the app." width="300" />
    <figcaption>
      One of the first screens a user should see in our redesign, prompts them to
      choose a goal that aligns with their lifestyle.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    We improved the interactivity of the 'action items' which would reduce user
    frustration with the app, and allow for more flexibility when it comes to a
    user's self monitoring.
  </p>

  <!-- !!! Add second pic (goalactions) here when ready to experiment with tables -->
  <figure class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">

    <figcaption>
      Here you can see the difference between the base homepage, and one after
      a user has chosen a goal and specific actions.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Finally we increased the options available to users in their settings and
    with their actions. This should help even out the time users initially spend
    with the app and increase long term engagement with a goal centric
    improvement model to build towards.
  </p>
  <!-- !!! Add pic table here when ready to experiment with tables -->

  <figure class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
    <ImgGetter imageArrayUnopt={goalRedesign} class="mx-auto" />
    <figcaption>
      Here is a collection of popups that could stem from a user trying to
      customize an action card.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h2>Reflection</h2><p>
    Through this capstone I have learned a lot about user research and team
    coordination. Since my group started with several user research methods I
    learned the most about what to expect and plan for in research settings.
    Including how to advertise for such opportunities, what to look out for and
    how to better control who is accepted into the studies. If I could have gone
    back and changed anything it would have been these primary user research
    cases. While grouping them at the start of our plan allowed us to
    efficiently run multiple of them at the same time it severely limited the
    takeaways we could have gathered if we spaced them out and iterated our
    designs between them. However this is an easy lesson to apply going forward
    and in this one case it helped us to solidify our design space when our
    sponsors had a hard time narrowing it down. In the future, the new
    experience with user research skills will be imperative when designing for
    spaces, micro-cultures, and technologies I do not have first hand experience
    with.
